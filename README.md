# GNU Radio website

## Install Prequisites

To render the GNU Radio website a recent [hugo](https://gohugo.io) installation in the extended mode is required.
If you are a masochist and you are familiar with `go get`. The easiest way to get `hugo` in the required version: `go get --tags extended -u github.com/gohugoio/hugo/`.
Your distro version of hugo is likely not the extended one, so go to:

https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

And download hugo_extended_0.53 for your operating system. Unpack and put
the binary in your path. Any other approach will make you angry and refuse
to work on the website!

## Run local development version

For viewing a new blogpost/news/article draft run `hugo -D server` and visit the rendered version in your browser at `localhost:1313`. The `-D` is required to show entries which are not yet marked for publishing with `draft: false`.

## How to add stuff to the website

If you want to make a change to the website, add a news or blog item, fix a
typo or whatever, simply clone this repo and make a pull request against it.
When the admins approve the PR, we will re-generate the website and upload the
new version.

This website uses the Hugo static site generator. Its documentation can be
found here: https://gohugo.io/documentation/

### How to add a news item

If you have Hugo running, simply run

    hugo new content/news/2018-XX-XX-short-title.md

and it will create a template for new. Alternatively, copy an old news item (if
you don't have Hugo running) and modify it accordingly.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to remove the `draft: true` line
from the file.

### How to add a blog article


### How to add a topic to the splash screen on the greeting page (the carousel)

When you go to https://gnuradio.org/, the first thing you see (under the menu)
is a great big picture, a "Learn More" button, and some tag line. It's called
the carousel because you can click the arrows on the left and right and it'll
give you different content.

To add one of those, or to change the order, go to `data/carousel` and add
another TOML file. The order is determined by the weight.
