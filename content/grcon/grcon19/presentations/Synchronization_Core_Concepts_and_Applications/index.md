Systems are evolving: channel counts are increasing, alignment requirements are tightening, and units are now spread far afield. These systems demand higher synchronization performance, as well as ease of use and installation. This presentation will review basic and advanced topics of baseband synchronization from the lens of USRP hardware.  We will compare methods of distributing time and aligned reference clocks through short-distance tree and daisy-chained topologies and how hardware setup can directly impact your synchronization results. Current market trends for aligning geographically distributed systems are also evolving rapidly. One such technology is White Rabbit, which enables baseband clock and time synchronization of less than 1 ns at distances up to 10 km! Come learn about USRP capabilities, how to avoid common pitfalls, and discover how to get the most out of your SDR equipment!
