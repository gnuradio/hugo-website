The small satellite community needs comprehensive access to mission enabling information and the ability to broadly share their knowledge and experience. The MetaSat schema aims to address these needs by functioning as a common way of describing hardware, software, and data specifications across missions to improve interoperability between them. In this way MetaSat will improve access to mission artifacts and enable their reuse by others. However, for the MetaSat team to fully support the diverse small satellite community and incorporate their quickly changing needs into the schema, they need to work directly with the stakeholders throughout the design process. This presentation will update the community on MetSat's progress and introduce attendees to ways they can help shape the schema's development.
