This paper presents an architecture for receiving arbitrarily wide bandwidth signals using multiple narrowband receivers.  Information contained in overlapping spectral regions provides the essential information needed to combine the separate receive channels and recover the original wideband signal as though it were captured by a single wideband receiver.  This paper presents details of the digital signal processing and synchronization needed to synthesize the wideband signal from multiple narrowband channels.  The method is validated through computer simulations.  Preliminary results of hardware implementation are also presented.
