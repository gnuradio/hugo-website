A common problem in realistic communication scenarios is dealing with other transmission sources on the same frequency at the same time.  We present a survey of situational awareness and interference mitigation techniques interactively demonstrated using GNU Radio with a focus on multi-antenna signal processing.  Various MIMO and Beamforming techniques will be explored and example code will be provided for participants to try in real time.
