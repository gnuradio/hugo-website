# Introduction

Huntsville, Alabama is a perfect place to host the GNU Radio Conference 2019. It has a concentration of Scientists, Engineers, and Technologists who work in a broad range of areas including NASA's Space Flight programs, Missile Defense, Genetics, and many associated disciplines. In addition, there are plenty of cultural and entertainment attractions.

There is a comprehensive guide to attractions and things to do at [Huntsville's Web Site](https://www.huntsville.org/), but the conference committee would like to make some specific recommendations for our conference.

## Conference Hotels

* The conference is taking place at the [Huntsville Marriott at the Space & Rocket Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hsval-huntsville-marriott-at-the-space-and-rocket-center/). The Marriott is walking distance from the [Huntsville Space and Rocket Center](https://rocketcenter.com/), so you and your family can visit there if you want (and we recommend it).

* The overflow hotel is the [Drury Inn & Suites Huntsville at the Space & Rocket Center](https://www.druryhotels.com/locations/huntsville-al/drury-inn-and-suites-huntsville-at-the-space-and-rocket-center). While this hotel is close to the conference hotel, it is not safe to walk between the hotels due to inadequate pedestrian accomodations and the need to cross the Interstate. The drive time between hotels is about 5-10 minutes.

* Camping is available at the [Monte Sano state park](https://www.alapark.com/campground). This is a lovely campground with pull-through, back-in, and tent camping spaces. There are also cabins available for rental in the park. The drive from the park to the conference hotel is 20-40 minutes, depending on traffic.

## Travel To and From Huntsville

Flying in and out of Huntsville Airport (HSV) is often expensive, with limited airline choices.

The carriers available in Huntsville are:

* American Airlines
* Delta Air Lines
* United Airlines
* Silver Airways
* Frontier Airlines

If you're going to rent a car and have the time, you can often save significantly by comparing flights into Nashville, TN (BNA) or Birmingham, AL (BHM). These are each about a two hour drive from the conference hotel. Southwest flies into both of these airports.

[Amtrak has a station in Birmingham](https://www.amtrak.com/stations/bhm), so you can take a train and rent a car. [Here's a route map](https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/Maps/Amtrak-System-Map-1018.pdf).

## Transit within Huntsville

If you don't have a car, we recommend using ride sharing services or taxis for local transportation.

Huntsville has very limited [public transportation](https://www.huntsvilleal.gov/residents/streets/public-transportation/shuttle-bus/), with several [city bus routes](https://maps.huntsvilleal.gov/PublicTransit/).

[Route 3](https://maps.huntsvilleal.gov/PublicTransit/maps/Route3_2015.pdf) stops at the Marriott at 31 minutes after the hour, and takes an hour to run that route. Tranfers only occur at the transit center, at the other end of the route. The last trip departs that transit center at 5 PM.

## Thursday evening social event

Everyone is welcome to attend the [Biergarten](https://www.rocketcenter.com/Biergarten) at the Space and Rocket Center. This event is open to the public, so bring your family and local friends. Food and beverages are available for purchase. If you purchase a ticket for this as part of your conference registration, it will cover food but not beverages.

You can almost always find someone on the 146.940 (PL 100.0, -600K offset) repeater, and it's a great place to ask for directions.
