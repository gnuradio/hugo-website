# Our Code of Conduct

In order to keep GRCon a fun, interesting, and positive experience for everybody, we expect participants to follow the guidelines, below.

GRCon aims to be a welcoming, open, and cooperative event.

This means we expect collaboration from all the GRCon participants, and for everybody to behave respectfully towards all others, including those that are different or think differently from yourself. Please be helpful, considerate, friendly, and respectful towards all other participants and respect the environment.

We don’t condone harassment or offensive behaviour at our conference. We consider it against our values as human beings. We expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct during the conference and related events. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media.

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without refund, and/or banned from formal participation in future events. Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of our coordinating team (contact details below).

Thank you for your help in making GRCon a success and pleasant for all the people involved.
