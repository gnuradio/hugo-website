# Student Registration

There are two levels of student registration. All students are required to submit a resume / CV, which will be provided to our student sponsors, and proof of student status, which will not be shared with anyone.

## Student Presenters

Students presenting a talk or poster at GRCon17 can register with this ticket type. In order to register as a Student Presenter, you must do the following:

* Submit your presentation abstract according to the Call for Presentations and Papers
* E-Mail your resume / CV to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* E-Mail proof of your student status to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* Purchase your “Student Presenter” registration on pretix

## Student Attendee

This ticket type is available to all students. In order to register as a Student Presenter, you must do the following:

* E-Mail your resume / CV to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* E-Mail proof of your student status to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* Purchase your “Student Attendee” registration on pretix

## Student Status

The goal of the Student Sponsorship program is to enable students for whom the conference registration might be an undue burden to still attend and participate in GRCon. You qualify for student registration if you are in grade school, a full or part-time undergraduate, or a full-time graduate student. Professionals with full-time employment do not qualify for student status. Proof of enrollment may be submitted any time prior to Fri 02 August.

Your “proof of student status” may take one of the following forms:

* An official confirmation of enrollment for the Fall academic period of 2019 from your university registrar.
* A registration transcript from your university showing course enrollment for the Fall academic period of 2019.
