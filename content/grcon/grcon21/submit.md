GRCon 2021 celebrates and showcases the substantial and remarkable progress of
GNU Radio and its usage in a diverse field of applications and industries.

We invite developers and users from across the GNU Radio Community to present your
projects, presentations, papers, posters, and problems at GNU Radio Conference
2021. Submit your talks, demos, and code!

**The Proposal Submission site will open up _March_ and the link will be posted here.**

## Submitting

You may make one or more submissions under the following categories for
presentation at GRCon. In addition to submitting a presentation, you may submit
a paper to the Technical Proceedings of GRCon21. You do not need to submit a
paper to the Proceedings in order to present at GRCon.

**Talks** are 30 minutes long, including 5 minutes reserved for audience
questions. Each presentation should be a slide-deck that can be shared publicly
(PDF) after the conference. Real-world results using GNU Radio and hardware
will be favored over simulation-only work.

Talks will be live-streamed, as well as recorded and published on the GNU Radio YouTube channel after the
conference.

**Papers** can be submitted with or without a talk.  Authors are encouraged to
attend the conference, but it is not a requirement for paper acceptance.
Detailed real-world results using GNU Radio are encouraged.

We request that papers are formatted according to this [LibreOffice
Template](/grcon_format_libreoffice.odt) or [LaTeX class](/grcon.tar.gz).

**Workshops** are 1–4 hours long, and should have an educational or “How-To”
approach, with a large hands on portion. If slides are used, they should be
publicly shareable (PDF) after the conference.

**Lightning Talks** are very concise (4-5 minutes), talks on topics of high
interest to GNU Radio users and developers, and provide a chance for new
presenters to share their use cases, projects or demos.

**Posters** can display any type of material that you believe is interesting to
the community, and while most posters are technical, they don’t have to be.

To submit your content for the conference, visit our dedicated conference
submission site when it opens in _March 2021_.
