Projects managing multiple components, languages, build tools, package managers, and hardware environments often lead to a dependency/environment hell. Presented is an intruduction to one way of managing the complexity using a tool called Nix which exhaustively tracks all dependencies in a declarative and reproducible manner. Demonstrate management of multiple versions of libraries/applications, environment isolation, and reproducible builds. Showcase complete build pipeline for multiple architectures, deployment methods, testing frameworks, and RF-in-the-loop validation of functionality. While still a work in progress, the effort yields specific recommendations for GNURadio which benefit similiar efforts and provides a mechanism for collaboration within and between teams.
