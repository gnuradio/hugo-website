There are several physical phenomena that RF and Communications engineers detest. Things like non-linear distortion, resonance and multi-path make it challenging to build radio/communication systems, and always have to be worked around or compensated. However, as we drop from gigahertz to kilohertz into the audio spectrum, we can take advantage some of these "dark" behaviors and turn them into something that sounds interesting to the ear. This talk will introduce some audio effects built in GNU Radio that embrace the impairments that communications engineers try to avoid. We will explore (and demonstrate) the common guitar effects of distortion, wah-wah and phasing to show how the dark side of DSP can also be used for good. This talk should show the flexibility of the GNU Radio platform as a general DSP framework that can be used to build more than just communication systems.
