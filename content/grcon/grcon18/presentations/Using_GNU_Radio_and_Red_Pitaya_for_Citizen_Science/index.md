This paper will consist of two portions.  We will cover the use of Red Pitaya with GNU Radio and a detailed performance analysis of the Red Pitaya will be given as well as suggested modifications to improve the performance.  The second portion will be the application of the Red Pitaya to Ionospheric Measurement, Solar Emission data, and Jovian-Io radio science data.  This will include discussion of the antennas needed to make each work.
