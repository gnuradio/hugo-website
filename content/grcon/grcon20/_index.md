GNU Radio Conference (GRCon) is the annual conference for the GNU Radio project & community, and has
established itself as one of the premier industry events for Software Radio. It
is a week-long conference that includes high-quality technical content and
valuable networking opportunities. GRCon is a venue that highlights design,
implementation, and theory that has been practically applied in a useful way.
GRCon attendees come from a large variety of backgrounds, including industry,
academia, government, and hobbyists.

GRCon20 is running this week, starting September 14th, online as a virtual event. The organizing team is hard at
work to create a fun and interactive experience. 

Our keynote speakers include: Becky Schoenfeld W1BXY, managing editor of QST magazine,

and Jim St. Leger, Director Open Source, Intel. 

With an annual program that has broad appeal, GRCon attracts people new to
Software Radio just looking to learn more, experts that want to keep their finger
