# About the Conference

GRCon is the annual GNU Radio conference, first held in 2011. With a stellar
program and engaging events, our attendees report an extremely high satisfaction
level year after year. In the GRCon16 Attendee Survey, 53% of conference
attendees rated the conference as an overall five-out-of-five, and 42% rated it
as a four-out-of-five.

GRCon20 will be held in [Charlotte, North Carolina](https://www.gnuradio.org/grcon/grcon20/charlotte/) and will continue
many of the successful program aspects from previous years, and add some new
items, as well.

## Conference Program

Packed with valuable content, the GRCon technical program is one of the best in the industry. With a great balance of cutting-edge research, new technology demonstrations, and shared insights from academia, industry, government, and the hobbyist community, GRCon is one of the best venues to learn and stay informed about the field of software radio. The GRCon program is recognized for its focus on practical design and implementation, and its content reflects the concept of “theory put into practice”.

To see last year’s technical program, check out the [GRCon19’s Presentations](/grcon/grcon19/presentations/).

## Tutorials & Walkthroughs

This year will see a renewed focus on tutorials and walkthroughs, presented by
GNU Radio and industry experts. We have re-structured the GRCon program to allow
for more tutorials than in previous years, and there will be a healthy mix of
tutorials aimed at new / novice users, and more intermediate / advanced users.
Walkthroughs will provide the opportunity to see how “the gurus” do their
development, and what their workflow looks like as they do something in
real-time.

## Published Paper Proceedings

We are pleased to once again host the Technical Proceedings of the Annual GNU
Radio Conference, which is an open-access publication venue for scientific
contribution to any field impacting Software Radio. The TP is available at
pubs.gnuradio.org, which is indexed by Google Scholar. Submissions go through a
strict peer-review process from area experts using the standard EDAS system.

## Keynotes & Panel Sessions

With an attendee list that includes some of the most recognized leaders in the
Software Radio industry, the GRCon keynotes and panel sessions offer an
opportunity to get the latest insights on opportunities, challenges, and the
direction of the industry.

## Vendor Exhibition & Demo Space

With the continued rise of GNU Radio in the commercial, academic, and government
sectors, the vendor booths offer a unique opportunity to see the latest Software
Radio technology from some of the field’s leaders.

## Technology Showcase & Poster Session

Every year, vendors, students, and hobbyists show off some of their latest
developments in the poster area. Meet the developers and researchers creating
next-generation Software Radio technologies.

## Social Events

We are proud to continue GRCon’s tradition of high-quality social events, which
provide an opportunity to network & get to know others in the community. Turnout
at GRCon socials is very high year after year, and we look forward to once again
offering a fun and unique experience. We'll publish more information on the
planned social events as they are confirmed!

## Amateur Radio License Exam

As in previous years, we expect to have a HAM radio license study and exam
session, to be followed by hands-on demos using low-cost hardware and GNU Radio.
If you are already licensed, this is a great opportunity to meet fellow HAMs and
learn about the use of GNU Radio for amateur radio!

<!-- Exams will be conducted by -->

<!-- requirements are detailed -->
<!-- [here](http://www.cavechamexam.com/huntsville-exam-site-info.html) in "What you -->

## Special Interest Focus Groups

One of the most exciting aspects of GRCon is the gathering of so many active
users, developers, and community leaders in one place. To this end, we are
pleased to put on focus groups for special interest areas including Education &
Curriculum Development, Radio Astronomy, Cybersecurity, Space-Based
Communications, and others. This is a great opportunity to meet others in the
Software Radio world with shared interests and discover new collaboration
opportunities.

## Developers’ Summit

A highlight of every year is the annual Developers’ Summit, which provides an
opportunity for developers to organize and provide time for practitioners to
work together & “talk shop”. This event is a great way to meet the core
developers of the project, find out how you can get involved, and influence
where the project is headed.
