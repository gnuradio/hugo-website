# Student Registration

There are two levels of student registration. All students are required to
submit a resume / CV, which will be provided to our student sponsors, and proof
of student status, which will not be shared with anyone.

## Student Presenters

Students presenting a talk or poster at GRCon20 can register with this ticket
type. In order to register as a Student Presenter, you must do the following:

* Submit your presentation abstract according to the Call for Presentations and Papers
* E-Mail your resume / CV to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* E-Mail proof of your student status to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* Purchase your “Student Presenter” registration on pretix

## Student Attendee

This ticket type is available to all students. In order to register as a
Student Presenter, you must do the following:

* E-Mail your resume / CV to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* E-Mail proof of your student status to `grcon@gnuradio.org`
* Purchase your “Student Attendee” registration on pretix

## Student Status

The goal of the Student Sponsorship program is to enable students for whom the
conference registration might be an undue burden to still attend and
participate in GRCon. You qualify for student registration if you are in grade
school, a full or part-time undergraduate, or a full-time graduate student.
Professionals with full-time employment do not qualify for student status.
Proof of enrollment may be submitted any time prior to 31 July.

Your “proof of student status” may take one of the following forms:

* An official confirmation of enrollment for the Fall academic period of 2020 from your university registrar.
* A registration transcript from your university showing course enrollment for the Fall academic period of 2020.
