Linux is traditionally the best-supported operating system for GNU Radio. The preferred installation method hence is typically installation through your Linux distribution's own package manager.

Make sure your Linux distribution is up to date â€“ outdated distributions ship outdated versions of GNU Radio. The **minimum supported version** of GNU Radio is 3.8. 3.7 and before are End-of-Life.
