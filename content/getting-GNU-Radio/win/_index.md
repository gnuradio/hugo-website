After having installed radioconda, you'll find a "radioconda" start menu entry. There, you'll find

- GNU Radio Companion, the graphical interface to GNU Radio flow graph design
  (you'll want to start here!), and
- Conda Prompt, a shell where all relevant settings are done, should you need or
  decide to install additional software, or build GNU Radio Out-of-Tree (OOT)
  Modules.
