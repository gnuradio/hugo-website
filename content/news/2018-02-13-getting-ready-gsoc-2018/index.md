# Getting ready for GSoC 2018

We are happy and excited to announce that we have been accepted by Google as a mentoring organization for the upcoming Google Summer of Code 2018! Same as in past years, we are looking forward to meeting students and hopefully passing on our love for FOSS! GSoC is a great opportunity for students, but equally important for GNU Radio as it helps us to find new and valuable contributors with fresh ideas that help us to further the project&#8217;s development.

So, what&#8217;s the next step? If you&#8217;re a student and interested in participating in GSoC, head over to our ideas list [0] and see if there&#8217;s a project that you&#8217;re interested in, there&#8217;s a lot of great project ideas! You&#8217;re into Python? Improve our gr_modtool, our out-of-tree creation tool that is used by so many developers! You prefer some number-crunching DSP? Why don&#8217;t you have a look at gr-radar or gr-inspector, a module for blind signal classification? You like making shiny GUIs with Qt? Create a nice app for viewing DTV and show the world what GNU Radio can do!

Once you have found something or even have your own project idea, introduce yourself to the mailing list ([discuss-gnuradio](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio)), let us know who you are, what you want to do and how you think you are going to achieve that!

Make sure you also read [1,2] to get an idea how the application process works, what we want to see in a proposal and how to become a successful GSoC student. The general GSoC timeline including the (very important!) deadlines can be found here [3]. The student application period officially begins in 4 weeks (March 12), but do not hesitate to introduce yourself before that date, especially if you have a project idea of your own for which you need to find a mentor!

GSoC is a great opportunity for you to improve your coding skills, network with experts, learn how open source projects work, make a real impact for a large user base, and (last but not least) earn some money during the summer months &#8211; don&#8217;t miss out on that! We&#8217;re looking forward to hear from you!
