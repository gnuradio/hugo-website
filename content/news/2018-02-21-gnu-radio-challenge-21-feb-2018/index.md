At 1222 EST on 21 Feb 2018, we posted a new signals challenge! There are *three* different challenges hidden in this signal capture, and the solution to each is a text message. One is on the easier side, and the two others are more advanced. If you believe you have found a solution, DM the answer to [@gnuradio on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnuradio) or e-mail [bhilburn@gnuradio.org](mailto:bhilburn@gnuradio.org)

The first THREE people to solve each of the three challenges will be declared winners. One person can only win one challenge; if correct solutions are submitted for multiple challenges, the most valuable will count as the win (a #1 spot, for example). If someone solves **all three** challenges **before the other nine winner spots are taken**, they will be declared the **Hat Trick Winner**, and will receive a special one-time t-shirt. Only one of these shirts will ever be printed.

The winners will receive honor and glory. Also, there will also be stickers and t-shirts awarded! See the list below for details.

The challenge will end when all ten spots have been claimed, or at 0000 EST (GMT-5) Mon 26 Feb &#8211; whichever comes first.

**THE CHALLENGE HAS CONCLUDED**

Good luck, and Happy Hacking!

**HINT (Posted 22 Feb):** Only one of the challenges is in the obvious signal.<br />
**HINT (Posted 23 Feb):** The loud broadband signal is coming from a satellite.<br />
**HINT (Posted 24 Feb):** The satellite signal is imagery. The rabbit signal is normally a subcarrier with metadata.<br />
**HINT (Posted 25 Feb):** Find the numbers station.

Note: The SigMF meta file has a small error &#8211; `fc32_le` should read `cf32_le`.
