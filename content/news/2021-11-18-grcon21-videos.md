GNU Radio Conference 2021 was a great success, with around 100 in-person attendees and over 1000 remote attendees!  
Talks were split between in-person and remote (pre-recorded). 
All talks are now available to watch on YouTube, you can find a [playlist that includes all videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBQHMnVMR41zZUZGF0bJArBXmpojtL9i).  You can also look through the [schedule of talks](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/8/timetable/#20210920) which contains more info about each talk, note that each day is in a different tab.
We look forward to seeing everyone at GRCon22!
