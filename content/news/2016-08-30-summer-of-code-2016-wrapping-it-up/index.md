# Summer of Code 2016: Wrapping it up

We&#8217;re nearing GNU Radio Conference, the summer is coming to an end &#8211; and so is the summer of code, at least for GNU Radio. This summer was a great summer in terms of student participation, and as the students are preparing their last commits, this seems a good time to summarize their efforts.

Unfortunately, one of our students had to withdraw his participation early in the summer. The remaining three students produced some great results, though!

Also, all three students will be presenting their work (either in person, or via poster) at this year&#8217;s GNU Radio Conference in Boulder, Colorado.

## gr-inspector

With gr-inspector, GNU Radio now has its first own out-of-tree module, which serves as a repository for signal analysis algorithms, but also as a collection of fantastic examples. This module was created and worked on by Sebastian MÃ¼ller (who was funded by Google Summer of Code) and Christopher Richardson (who participated as a SOCIS student, funded by the European Space Agency). Sebastian also created a video demonstrating some of the features:

Both Sebastian and Chris have written up their efforts on their own blogs. Sebastian&#8217;s blog:

## PyBOMBS GUI

Ravi Sharan was our other GSoC student, primarily working on a GUI for PyBOMBS, our installation helper tool. Ravi also worked on a bunch of other things, and has summarized his efforts as well:

The PyBOMBS GUI is written in QT, and is a nice extension to our out-of-tree module ecosystem:

While some developers prefer the comfort of their command line environments, we hope that the PyBOMBS GUI will ease the entry for more new developers. The GUI ties in nicely with http://cgran.org, and with the correct setup, users can directly launch installation of out-of-tree modules from their browser.

## Want to participate? Have ideas?

We will definitely re-apply for GSoC and SOCIS next year! If you want to participate, it helps a lot to get involved with the community early on. As a student, we recommend you sign up for the mailing list, and get involved with GNU Radio by using it, reporting and fixing issues, or even publishing your own out-of-tree module. Take a look at our summer of code wiki pages:

- [http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GSoC](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GSoC)

If you simply have ideas for future projects, those are welcome too! Suggest those on the mailing list, or simply edit the wiki page.
