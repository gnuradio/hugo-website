# Google Summer of Code &#8217;17: GNU Radio is in!

## GNU Radio takes part in GSoC 2017

**Aww, yes!** GNU Radio has been selected to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017. Find the full list of organizations on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-page=2).

As this is the very beginning of GSoC, we don&#8217;t know yet how many students we will be able to accept. However, it&#8217;ll be at least one, so it&#8217;s not too early to start working on your application! Head over to our [wiki page on GSoC](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GSoC) to find our ideas list, and the student instructions.

## Participating as a student

If you&#8217;re interested in participating, the most important thing to do to increase your chances is to get in touch with the community as soon as possible. If you haven&#8217;t done so yet, sign up to the mailing list, join our IRC or Slack channel, and start talking to other developers. Also, you should work on your application sooner rather than later. Publishing your application even at an early stage also has proven to increase your chances of participating.

We&#8217;re looking forward to working with you!
