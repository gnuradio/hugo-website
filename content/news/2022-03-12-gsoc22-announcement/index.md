Hooray! GNU Radio has once again been accepted as a mentoring organization for
Google Summer of Code. This means that we will soon be accepting proposals from
students/contributors who want to spend their summer hacking on GNU Radio.

Our [ideas list has](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GSoCIdeas) been updated
for this year’s GSoC installment, and we are eagerly awaiting your project
proposals! This year we have ideas ranging from GPU acceleration to WASM
porting, and there are ideas on both ends of the difficulty spectrum.
Application opens on April 4, and lasts until April 19, but students are
strongly encouraged to get in touch with the community ahead of time. We’re
happy to give you feedback on your proposal or answer questions that you may
have.

Once you have found something or even have your own project idea, take a look at
the [Student Info
page](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoCStudentInfo) and [GSoC
Manifest](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoCManifest) to learn more
about the process. Next, introduce yourself to the [mailing list
(discuss-gnuradio)](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio),
let us know who you are, what you want to do and how you think you are going to
achieve it! The [GSoC 2022 landing
page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022) and
[student/contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) also
contains some useful information.

GSoC 2022 comes with a few changes to the format. Most importantly, projects can
be either 175 or 350 hours, and the coding period length can be anywhere from 10
to 22 weeks. The formal requirements for contributors have also been relaxed,
meaning that you no longer need to be enrolled at a university to be eligible.
However, you have to be an open source beginner.

GSoC is a great opportunity for you to get involved with the FOSS community and
earn some money while enhancing your coding skills. We at GNU Radio are looking
forward to reading your project proposals. Good luck!
