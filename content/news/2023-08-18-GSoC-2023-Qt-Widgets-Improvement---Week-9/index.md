Welcome to another update on the progress of the GSoC 2023 Qt Widgets Improvement project. In this Week 9 blog post, I am excited to share that I have created documentation for the Qt GUI integration tutorial on the GNU Radio wiki page.

## Documentation for Qt GUI Integration Tutorial

To enhance user understanding and provide a comprehensive guide, I have developed detailed documentation for integrating Qt GUI into GNU Radio projects. This tutorial covers various aspects such as custom layouts, generating .ui files, and seamlessly integrating them within our flowgraphs.

*https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=QT_Designer_Integration*

The document covers the following topics:

- **Introduction**: An overview of Qt as a cross-platform C++ framework for developing applications with rich graphical user interfaces.

- **Dependencies**: The dependencies required for integrating Qt GUI components in GNU Radio projects, including Qt5 and Qt Designer.

- **Creating Custom Layouts**: Instructions on creating custom layouts in Qt to arrange and organize GUI elements effectively.

- **Editing .ui Files in Qt Designer**: How to open and customize generated .ui files using the intuitive interface of Qt Designer.

- **Integrating .ui Files**: Steps for loading and integrating .ui files into Python code using the uic module.

- **Running the Custom Layout**: Executing your Python script to run your customized layout within GNU Radio projects.

- **Tips and Considerations**: Helpful tips and considerations when working with Qt integration in GNU Radio, such as resolving layout errors.
