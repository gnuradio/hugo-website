We are excited to announce GNU Radio Conference 2021 will be running as an in-person event in Charlotte, NC alongside our virtual component. GRCon21, which will be held September 20-24, 2021, celebrates and showcases the substantial and remarkable progress of GNU Radio and its usage in a diverse field of applications and industries.

GRCon21 will be held in Charlotte, NC - the home of NASCAR, which is the perfect location to focus on the theme of _SPEED_: processing high rate, high throughput data with GNU Radio and to showcase many of the high performance platforms and applications that have been developed across our community.

Taking into account the current status of COVID-19 in the US and our survey results, we have determined that we can safely hold an in-person event.
