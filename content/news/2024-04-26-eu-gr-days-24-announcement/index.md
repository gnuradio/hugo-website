### Announcing the 2024 European GNU Radio Days at FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany

The 2024 edition of the European GNU Radio Days will be held at the international accelerator facility FAIR in Darmstadt, Germany's 'City of Science', from August 27 to 31, 2024.  The conference aims at fostering collaboration between users and developers of the free and open-source GNU Radio framework by helping scientific, academic, industrial and hobbyist alike to discuss the latest developments.

**Focus of the Conference**

This edition is centered on the release of GNU Radio 4.0, with tutorials designed to train newcomers on the advancements of this framework reboot. 

We invite contributions on various topics, including:
  - Digital Communication
  - RADAR and Base-Band Signal Processing
  - Hardware Enhancements, RF Frontend, and Backend accelerators (i.e. SIMD, GPU, etc.)  
  - Advanced Signal Processing and Control
  - Synchronisation of distributed coherent SDR frameworks
  
**Special Features of the Workshop**

The workshop will offer both plenary talks and introductory tutorials, and two parallel tracks highlighting hands-on sessions specifically tailored for GNU Radio users and C++ developers. To ensure personalised guidance and effective learning, tutorials will be conducted in small groups (4-8 participants). Due to this format, space is limited -- **register early to secure your spot!**
