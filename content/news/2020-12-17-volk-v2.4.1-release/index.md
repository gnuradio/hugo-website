Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK bugfix release! We are happy to announce [VOLK v2.4.1](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/releases/tag/v2.4.1)! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

Our v2.4.0 release introduced quite a lot of changes under the hood. With this bugfix release, we want to make sure that everything works as expected again.
