# Call for Participation: SDR/DSP Devroom at FOSDEM 2026

The **Software Defined Radio / Digital Signal Processing (SDR/DSP)** devroom is being organized for **FOSDEM 2026**, held in **Brussels, Belgium**, on **Sunday, February 1, 2026**.

We are seeking contributions discussing **free and open-source software (FOSS)** for discrete-time **digital signal processing** and **software-defined radio (SDR)**. Topics of interest (RF and non-RF) may include:

- Digital communication and data integrity (CRC calculation, Forward Error Correction - FEC)  
- Communication channel characterization  
- Navigation and positioning  
- Target ranging and velocity measurement  
- Signal characteristic extraction from raw IQ data (single or multiple antennas)
- 5G/6G/FutureG 
- AI-enabled communications and signal processing
- Software frameworks supporting these applications, including **GNU Radio**, **FutureSDR**, **Pothosware**, or custom/novel frameworks  

We also welcome presentations on **open-hardware designs** - especially those leveraging **FPGAs**, **GPUs**, or other accelerators - using FOSS tools. Demonstrations of how RF-grade oscilloscopes can function as discontinuous-stream SDR receivers would be one such example.

🗓 **Proposal deadline:** November 15, 2025  
💻 **Submit via:** [FOSDEM Pretalx](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/cfp)

Join us in Brussels to share your work and advance the state of open SDR and DSP!
