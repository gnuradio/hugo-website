Part of the value of our [Block Doc
pages](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Category:Block_Docs) is having
an Example Flowgraph to show how that block can be used. In a recent review of
our 555 current blocks, 214 of them do not have an Example Flowgraph!

Look at the [Pages with no Example
Flowgraph](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Category:Pages_with_no_Example_Flowgraph)
the [Stub Docs](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Category:Stub_Docs)
categories for the lists.

So, we are appealing to you to help supply those flowgraphs. There are three sources which come to mind:

- find an example flowgraph in our [source code repository](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio)
- use a flowgraph from your applications of GNU Radio
- create a flowgraph to illustrate the block

If you have any questions on how you work with our documentation, you're most
welcome to contact our documentation team on
[#docs:gnuradio.org!](https://matrix.to/#/#docs:gnuradio.org)!
