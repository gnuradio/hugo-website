Just as the year closes, it's time to remind people that a fantastic event
is going to take place at the beginning of February:

# FOSDEM 2022

FOSDEM is *the* Free- and Open Source conference in Europe! GNU Radio has had a
strong presence there for the last few years, and 2022 will be no different. If you did something fun and interesting with Software Radio(s) and Free Software do not hesitate to submit to our Devroom. We are actively looking for great presentations around Software Radio, cellular communications, satellite communications, and more. See more details in this [Call for Participation (CfP)](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2021q4/003328.html) and if you are unsure you can contact the devroom managers via radio-devroom-manager@fosdem.org. We are happy to host your presentation if it fits our Devroom! 

In these uncertain times (w.r.t restrictions and last minute cancellation of big evenst) FOSDEM 2022 will happen virtually via Matrix and pre-recorded presentations with live Q&A. It would have been great to travel to Brussels again to meet old friends and make new friends in the Free Software world, but it seems we have to wait another year to do that.
