We are gearing up for GNU Radio Conference 2021, which will be held September 20-24, 2021.
GRCon 2021 celebrates and showcases the substantial and remarkable progress of
GNU Radio and its usage in a diverse field of applications and industries.

**Note: The determination of whether the conference will need to go fully virtual based on the evaluation of safety for all attendees will be made closer to the conference dates - targeting April 2021 for this decision**

If in-person, GRCon21 will be held in Charlotte, NC - the home of NASCAR, which is the perfect location 
to focus on the theme of _SPEED_: processing high rate
high throughput data with GNU Radio and showcase many of the high performance platforms and applications
that have been developed across our community.

We invite developers and users from across the GNU Radio Community to present your
projects, presentations, papers, posters, and problems at GNU Radio Conference
2021, so start thinking about what great work you would like to present at this year's conference.

Although we are not yet starting to sell tickets or accept proposals through the submission website
we invite you to pre-register to receive event notifications and updates on this year's conference.

To sign up for email notifications and updates, please visit our [Registration page](https://tickets.gnuradio.org/grcon21/).

The proposal submission system will open up early March, so start thinking about your **Papers**, **Talks**, and **Posters**.

Event Registration will open after the announcement in April about being in-person, so be on the lookout to get in on the Early Bird rates.
