<h4 class="row">Dear GNU Radio community,</h4>

<div class="row">
the GRCon'22 organizing committee has been able to set up all the mechanics behind the scenes, and so:

<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
GRCon'22 takes place September 26 – 30, 2022 in Washington, DC.
It is the central event for the GNU Radio community, with its scope including
applications, technological, commercial and regulatory developments 
involving GNU Radio and the SDR ecosystem. It traditionally hosts a wide range
of governmental, industrial, academic and non-profit presentations and has
established itself as a prime venue for users, vendors, developers and scientists 
involved in the FOSS SDR ecosystem.
</p>

<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
Ticket prices remain fixed until the end of the conference. It significantly helps our
ability to make financial commitments if you do register early, though.
</p>

<h2 class="col-sm-9">In-Person Attendance Tickets</h2>

<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
As we'll be able to meet up in person again this year, you'll find a couple of
in-person attendance ticket tiers.
</p>
<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
These all grant the same level of access,
but address different target audiences. For this GRCon, there are two main 
registration levels: Standard and Discounted. The conference would be less 
useful to the community and less attractive to our sponsors if you weren't there! 
Use your best judgement on what works best for your situation. 
If you have any questions, please do reach out to tickets@gnuradio.org.

<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">
Standard Registration
</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">
If your organization is paying for you to attend, please select this option.
</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">
Discounted Registration
</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
If you're an individual attending at your own cost,
feel free to consider this option. Others who may not be able to attend at the
Standard Registration cost, should also consider this option.

<dt class="col-sm-3">
Student Registration
</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
Heavily subsidized. Applies to students currently in enrolled in a university program (or secondary school). 
In exchange for subsidizing your ticket, your CV will be shared with our student sponsors. 
If you are a student and present something at the conference, you can even get a free voucher.
Please read <a href="https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/page/58-student-registration">
the Student Regsitration Guide</a> before selecting Student Registration.

✨Patron Supporter Registration✨
</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
Interested in providing additional support
to the project? Looking for an uncomplicated way to get your company logo on the GRCon'22 website?
This is the "easiest" and lowest-cost of our sponsorship levels; you pay an
extra $250 (cost of Patron sponsorship) atop the Standard Registration. See <a href="https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/page/49-sponsorship-opportunities">Sponsorship Opportunities for additional details</a>!

<h2 class="col-sm-9">Virtual Attendance Tickets</h2>
</div>

<div class="row">
<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
As has been for the last years, the GNU Radio conference will be <a href="https://grcon.stream">live streamed</a>,
for free.  Everyone, in-person or remote, is encouraged to partake in discussion using our online chat system.
</p>
<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
You do not <emph>have</emph> to register to participate, but we would appreciate it.
It's a "pay what you want" system, and is designed to reduce the cost of the
streaming setup – after all, we're paying a professional crew full-time for the
main track to make sure our streams are good!
</p>
<p class="col-sm-12 text-justify">
Even if you to not decide to pay anything, registration through the ticketing
interface gives us <emph>statistics</emph>, something we can use to dimension chat infrastructure, talk to future sponsors, and address the needs of our online audience better.

<h2 class="col-sm-9">Call for Participation</h2>
