Attention all GNU Radio enthusiasts, Software Defined Radio (SDR) developers, and radio
frequency experts! Join ADI as we get ready for GRCon24, where we’ll dive into the world
of SDR. The conference will be full of knowledge and innovation, featuring sessions and
demos that will reshape how you think about SDR technology. Find our ADI booth on-site
and connect with us.

At our booth, you can experience hands-on demonstrations of Jupiter, our latest 6 GHz
SDR; Phaser, an 8-channel phased array exploration platform; and Apollo Triton, featuring
28 GSPS and 4 channels. Additionally, check out a co-developed demo with Airbus
Defense and Space, highlighting a complete 5G base station (gNodeB) on cutting-edge
processing platforms designed for in-orbit use. If you can&#39;t make it to the event but want to
catch the main talk, visit this link for live streaming details (Eastern Daylight Time) and
information on how to join the chat.

### Explore Innovations
**Enhanced Capabilities of the ADALM-PLUTO for GNU Radio Enthusiasts**

Jon Kraft | September 19 at 16:05 | Ballroom AB

We invite you to join us for an in-depth exploration of the latest features and
enhancements to the ADALM-PLUTO SDR. This session covers the new Time-Division
Duplex (TDD) engine that controls the timing of transmit and receive. You’ll also learn
tips and tricks for using the 2nd transmit and receive channel and explore shared
context mode to access Pluto data remotely.

### Expand Radar Capabilities
**Adding Pluto/Phaser Radar Support into GR-Plasma**

Dr. Justin Metcalf and Jon Kraft | September 19 at 15:35 | Ballroom AB
Don’t miss this 30-minute session with Jon Kraft and Dr. Justin Metcalf where you’ll
explore how to add the Pluto and Phaser (CN0566) support into this radar module.

### Discover Open Source
**Open Source HDL/IP and Software Components for Building Leading-Edge SDRs**

Michael Hennerich | September 18 at 16:20 | Ballroom AB

This talk explores the journey and evolution of software-defined radio (SDR)
development, starting with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) modules and moving
towards custom hardware with discrete digitizers and FPGAs.

You will learn how open-source resources can accelerate the development of advanced
SDR systems, covering everything from RF interfaces to buffer management. Join us to
see how leveraging open-source HDL/IP and software tools is driving innovation and
pushing the boundaries of SDR technology in the rapidly evolving wireless
communication landscape.

### Accelerate Development
**AD-JUPITER-EBZ - Agile SDR in-a-box**

Mihai Bancisor | September 18 at 13:00 | Ballroom AB

Explore how Jupiter SDR and SYNCHRONA14 are revolutionizing SDR evaluation and
prototyping. These open-source platforms speed up product development, reduce risk,
and accelerate time-to-market.
