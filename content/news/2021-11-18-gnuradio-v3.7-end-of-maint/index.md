We are officially ending maintenance of v3.7. There will be no further v3.7.X.X releases, and pull requests will no longer be accepted for the maint-3.7 branch.

The last v3.7 release (v3.7.14.0) was over 18 months ago and there are only a handful of unreleased commits on the maint-3.7 branch. Packagers/distributions have moved on to newer versions. Additionally, we are not set up to do automated testing on maint-3.7 and need to apply our development/maintenance efforts to v3.8, v3.9 and the upcoming v3.10.

Of course, this is open source, so there is no End of Life if packagers are still interested in v3.7. If you still package v3.7, please let us know.
