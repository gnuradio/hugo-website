As planned for Week 9, an XML to YAML generator has been added to the modtool. A new CLI command, update, has been added to the existing modtool commands that serves the purpose of conversion of XML scripts to YAML scripts. The functionality can also be achieved through the API class, ModToolUpdate. I would like to thank my mentors and Håkon Vågsether for helping me throughout.
