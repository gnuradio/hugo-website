As planned for Week 10, I have created a mock GUI for the modtool. I have also added the commits from the branch yaml, which contained the cli and core modules for the XML to YAML conversion, into the branch swapnil_nextâ€‹. I have also condensed all the remaining work of the other PRs into the main PR.
