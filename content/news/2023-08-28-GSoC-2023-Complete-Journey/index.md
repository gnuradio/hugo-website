## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to elevate the user experience of GNU Radio flowgraphs by introducing new GUI sinks, refactoring existing Qt GUI sinks, and integrating Qt Designer with GNU Radio. This comprehensive approach aimed to provide users with more intuitive visualizations, customizable interfaces, and an overall enhanced workflow.

## New GUI Sinks :

#### **[Matrix Sink]((https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=QT_GUI_Matrix_Sink))**

The Matrix Sink was conceived as a powerful tool for visualizing matrix data in a dynamic and insightful way. The journey began with the careful design of parameters and functionalities such as vector size, contour plots, color maps, and interpolation methods. Leveraging the Qwt Spectrogram library, I was able to present matrix data as captivating color maps, each element in the matrix represented by a distinctive color. This transformation allowed for quick interpretation and analysis of the data. The Matrix Sink block's appearance was polished through meticulous adjustments to the color map and other visual elements, ensuring an interface that was both user-friendly and informative.

#### *`Future improvements for the Matrix Sink :`*

* Add more customization options for the color map, axis labels, and other visual elements.

* Integrate zoom and pan functionalities.

* Add support for more data types.

* Improve the performance of the Matrix Sink.


#### **[Video Display Sink](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=QT_GUI_Video_Display)**

The Video Display Sink brought dynamic video visualization capabilities to GNU Radio. Leveraging the Qt Multimedia library, I implemented real-time video display and audio playback. This sink was designed with a user-friendly interface, incorporating playback controls, seek functionality, volume adjustments, and more. It was a significant step towards enriching the multimedia experience within GNU Radio.

{{<figure src="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/images/e/e8/Video_display.png" alt="Video Display Sink" width="800px">}}

#### *`Future improvements for the Video Display :`*

* **Consider the changes in the Qt Multimedia API** : The Qt Multimedia API has undergone significant changes in Qt 6, including the rewritten GStreamer backend. This means that the Video Display Sink will need to be updated to use the new API when transitioning to Qt6.

* **Add new features** : The Video Display Sink could be extended to support new features, such as the ability to save the current display as an image.

* Add support for more data types.

* Improve the performance of the Video Display.

## **[Refactoring Qt GUI Sinks](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/pull/6790)**
The refactoring process involved enhancing the existing Frequency Sink, Waterfall Sink,Time Sink, Time Raster Sink, Eye Sink and Sink blocks. By adopting a generic and template-based approach, I ensured compatibility with various data types. This not only streamlined the codebase but also resulted in better performance and increased flexibility.

## **[Integration of Qt Designer](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=QT_Designer_Integration)**
The integration of Qt Designer with GNU Radio brought a new level of convenience and flexibility to GUI creation. The process of creating custom layouts was simplified through the generation of .ui files from flowgraphs. These files could be easily loaded into Python code using the uic module, thus streamlining the creation of interactive and visually appealing interfaces. Users could now design and modify their GUI interfaces with unprecedented ease. This development eliminated the need for manual GUI creation, fostering the creation of interactive and visually appealing layouts.
