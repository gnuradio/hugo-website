Hi everyone!

We have another VOLK release! We're happy to announce [VOLK v2.4.0](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/releases/tag/v2.4.0)! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We introduce `cpu_features` as a private submodule in this release because we use it to detect CPU features during runtime now. This should enable more reliable feature detection. Further, it takes away the burden to implement platform specific code. As a result, optimized VOLK kernels build for MacOS and Windows with AppleClang/MSVC out-of-the-box now.


### Highlights

* Documentation
    - Update README to be more verbose and to improve usefulness.

* Compilers
    - MSVC: Handle compiler flags and thus architecture specific kernels correctly. This enables optimized kernels with MSVC builds.
    - AppleClang: Treat AppleClang as Clang.
    - Paired with the `cpu_features` introduction, this enables us to use architecture specific kernels on a broader set of platforms.
* CI
    - Update to newest version of the Intel SDE
    - Test the rotator kernel with a realistic scalar
    - Introduce more test cases with newer GCC and newer Clang versions.
* CMake
    - Enable to not install `volk_modtool`.
    - Remove "find_package_handle_standard_args" warning.
* cpu_features
    - Use `cpu_features` v0.6.0 as a private submodule to detect available CPU features.
    - Fix incorrect feature detection for newer AVX versions.
    - Circumvent platform specific feature detection.
    - Enable more architecture specific kernels on more platforms.
* Kernels
    - Disable slow and broken SSE4.1 kernel in `volk_32fc_x2_dot_prod_32fc`
    - Adjust min/max for `32f_s32f_convert_8i` kernel
    - Use `INT8_*` instead of `CHAR_*`
