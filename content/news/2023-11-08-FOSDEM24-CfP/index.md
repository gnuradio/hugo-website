# Software Defined Radio & Amateur Radio Devroom at FOSDEM &#8217;24 (3. & 4. February 2024)

Dear Friends of Free and Open Source Radio!

FOSDEM 2024, the Free and Open Source Developer’s Meeting taking place in
Brussels, Belgium, 3. & 4. February 2024, will once again feature a track on
FOSS-powered Radio; this year, there will be a combined Amateur Radio and SDR
Devroom:

https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/radio/

In case you're wondering what Amateur Radio and Software-Defined Radio are, we
have a small introduction below. See the "Recommended Topics" section!

We invite developers and users of Free Software from these fields and to
contribute to this event by presenting their projects, ideas and their work.

Please read our Call for Presentations below:
See you in Brussels!

Bastien, Marc and Marcus

Submit Your Presentations!
=====================

To suggest a talk, go to

https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024/cfp

"Submit a proposal" and fill in the fields; make sure it's in the *Software
Defined Radio and Amateur Radio* track!

Content and Shape of Presentations
----------------------------------

Please aim for your talk to be 20 to 25 minutes long, which leaves enough time
for questions & answers within a 30 minute slot.

The final schedule will be available through Pretalx and the official FOSDEM
website. Notice that the reference time will be Brussels local time (CET).

In the Software Defined Radio and Amateur Radio devroom, we aren’t constrained
to holding slideshow presentation – bring your demo, your prototype! However,
since this is a software community conference, please refrain from offering
marketing-style presentations. Give the radio experts something to chew on! We
like the nitty-gritty technical details.

Travel Aid
----------

If you are a young person, and cannot afford to travel to Brussels and stay
there, please do contact us as early as possible with an itemized estimate of
your financial needs, and remark that you've done so in your proposal's
"Submission Notes". The International Amateur Radio Union Region 1 has
generously offered to assist financially for up to two contributors.

Recommended Topics
------------------

Topics discussed in the devroom include, but are not limited to:

- SDR frameworks and the tools that make them useful
- New SDR-based developments in ham radio modes
- Cellular/telecom software
- Amateur radio operator software tooling
- Free / Open radio hardware
- Wireless security research
- Entertaining wireless hacks
- SDR & ham radio in mass and higher education
- Satellite, spacecraft and interplanetary communication

Software-Defined Radio is the technology of enabling radio signals to be
processed and generated algorithmically,  typically within general purpose
processors, but also within FPGAs and GPUs; Free and Open Source (FOSS)
Software Radio allows these  algorithms to be inspectable and improvable. With
the advent of ubiquitous IoT, sky-filling satellite megaconstellations and
5G/6G as standards designed with commercial Software Radios in mind, wireless
is an exploding field of interest in the FOSS realm.

Ham Radio, also known as amateur radio, is more than just a hobby orbiting the
usage of radio communication – it's a passion that merges the realms of
electronics, human interaction, and communication. At its core, ham radio is
about establishing connections: with people, with technology, and with the
world at large. It is a free and open community effort at heart!
