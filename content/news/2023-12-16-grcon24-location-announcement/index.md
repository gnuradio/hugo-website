We are excited to announce that GNU Radio Conference 2024 (GRCon24) will be run as an in-person event September 16*-20 at the Knoxville Convention Center in downtown Knoxville, TN.

GRCon24 will celebrate and showcase the substantial and remarkable progress of GNU Radio and its usage in a diverse field of applications and industries.  It is a 4 day conference (Main Track Tues-Fri)  that includes high-quality technical content and valuable networking opportunities. GRCon is a venue that highlights design, implementation, and theory that has been practically applied in a useful way. GRCon attendees come from a large variety of backgrounds, including industry, academia, government, and hobbyists.  Even though the main track will start on Tuesday Sept. 17, this year we are planning a “soft start” to the conference with various hands-on activities on Monday afternoon/evening, such as beginner tutorials and in-person help installing and getting started using GNU Radio.


Preliminary details about the event for participants and attendees are available on the [event website](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/24/), but please go ahead and start thinking about what great work you would like to present at this year’s conference - the Call for Participation will be opening soon..

If you have questions or would like to find out more about becoming one of our valued sponsors please contact us at grcon@gnuradio.org.  Note that this event can only be successful because of our sponsors - please see the sponsors that made GRCon23 possible. 

Since GRCon is run by a group of volunteers, we are also looking for people to help with both the planning of and assisting during the event. If you are interested in volunteering in any capacity, please reach out to us grcon@gnuradio.org
