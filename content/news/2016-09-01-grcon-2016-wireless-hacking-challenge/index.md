# GRCon 2016 Wireless Hacking Challenge

Show off  your radio hacking skills during this year&#8217;s Wireless Hacking Challenge during the GNU Radio Conference!

Bastille Networks is putting together a multi-frequency, multi-protocol, multi-complicated series of RF puzzles, and will be awarding the winner and runner up with a prize each (USRP B200mini in a custom case!).

To keep it interesting for anyone that wishes to attempt the challenge, we will keep puzzle details light here. However we can reveal:

- The puzzles will be broadcasting through each of the conferences days during official hours.
- Contestant registration and tracking will be done through a web interface.
- Puzzles will be designed to have increasing difficulty: the first one will be really easy for anyone to find. Once you complete a stage, there will often be a hint to send you in the right direction for the next stage.
- Puzzles and/or their hints may be released/made more obvious over the course of the week, depending on participant progress.
- We will make it quite obvious when the final stage has been completed.
- You must complete all the puzzles to win.
- You should have a hacking setup that includes a recent distribution of GNU Radio, a SDR that is capable of reception and transmission on a wide range of frequencies, and be able to run Python snippets and the usual cmake/make/make install(/ldconfig).

Time allowing, we will attempt to deploy a secure Over-The-Air &#8216;puzzle solution&#8217; system, so you will need to interact with the Challenge system to let it know you have successfully completed the puzzle. More details to come.

Tools to enable general spectrum scanning/plotting and demodulation (e.g. baudline, Gqrx, HDSDR) provide a good starting point.

Several members of the Bastille Research team will be around to help if you need any assistance.

Good luck!
