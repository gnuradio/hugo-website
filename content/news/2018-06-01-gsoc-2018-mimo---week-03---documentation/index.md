I think about the proposed MIMO feature not just as a functioning tool but as well as an instructive and attractive feature for GNU Radio beginners to understand MIMO. Therefore, I started to write a little in-tree top-level documentation which includes both, an introduction to the theoretical background of MIMO and a practical usage manual of all the GNU Radio blocks which are included in the section MIMO.
