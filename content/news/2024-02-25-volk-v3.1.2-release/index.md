Hi everyone!

This is the VOLK v3.1.2 release! We want to thank all contributors.
This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

The last maintenance release revealed issues in areas that are difficult to test. 
While the changes to the library should be minimal, usability should be improved. 
Most notably, we build and deploy [the VOLK documentation](https://www.libvolk.org/docs) 
automatically now.
