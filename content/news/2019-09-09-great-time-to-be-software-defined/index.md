It’s that time of the year when the open-source, software defined radio (SDR) community gathers for the annual GNU Radio Conference, or GRCon, for short. The ninth installment of this premier industry event is taking place September 16–20 in Huntsville, Alabama, at the Huntsville Marriot at the Space & Rocket Center, and NI is proud to serve as diamond sponsor along with its brand, Ettus Research.

GRCon19 participants have several opportunities to interact with NI subject matter experts through a variety technical sessions, workshops, and live demos. At these forums, participants get to discuss the latest SDR trends, including new USRP innovations, the use of open-source software in 5G wireless technology, and DOD programs. Read on for more details.
