Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.0! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

This release adds new kernel implementations and fixes. Some of these were longstanding PRs that could only be merged recently thanks to our switch from CLA to DCO.

### Announcements

I would like to point out one upcoming change. After this release, we will rename our development branch to `main` as discussed in [issue #461](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/461).


I'd like to point the community to this [VOLK relicensing GREP](https://github.com/gnuradio/greps/pull/33).
This is an ongoing effort to relicense VOLK under LGPLv3.
We're looking for people and organizations that are interested in leading this effort.
