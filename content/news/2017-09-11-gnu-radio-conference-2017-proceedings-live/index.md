# GNU Radio Conference 2017 Proceedings Live


[![https://pubs.gnuradio.org/](https://gnuradio.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pubs-300x214.png)](https://pubs.gnuradio.org/)


This year marks the second ever GNU Radio Conference Technical Proceedings (TP).  The TP is intended to provide a venue for more detailed and longer lasting results publication than what can be conveyed in a 30 minute talk at the conference.  As a result we adopted the current TP format, which takes the form of a free and open access research paper publication.  Speakers may elect to submit a paper to accompany their talk, and people doing good work in the area unable to attend the conference or give a talk may also elect to submit a paper from afar.  This year the single-cycle single-blind review process accepted 19 great papers (up from 10 last year).

Papers may all be accessed and read on our publication archive at [http://pubs.gnuradio.org](https://pubs.gnuradio.org/).  Thank you to all who took the time to write and contribute high quality papers and to those who helped in the review and orchestration process.  The papers included this year are shown below in no particular order, and we look forward to all of your great contributions next year continuing to make this the premier open source applied software radio venue.
