[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 10 - 22 week programming project under the guidance of mentors. GNU Radio has participated in GSoC since 2012 with a high success rate. We are currently accepting applications!

- Find out what you want to do. This could be something from the ideas list, but it doesn't have to be. Get creative! 
- Send us an early draft of your project proposal. This is kind of a hack, because it enables us to give you feedback on your proposal before the deadline. You can use this feedback to make your proposal even better! Just make sure you have read [the contributor instructions](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoCStudentInfo) before submitting your proposal.

Many good ideas from previous years are on the old ideas list. If you are interested in one of these ideas try to contact the mentor and also send messages to the GNU Radio mailing list and chat.
