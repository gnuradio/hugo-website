This is the list of proposed [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) projects.

If you're a student who's interested in spending your summer contributing code
to GNU Radio, the by far most popular Software Defined Radio project in the Free
and Open Source World, then:
[Register](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio) for the GNU
Radio Mailing List and introduce yourself!

Doing that early is a great opportunity to get to know the community, for the
community to get to know you, and for you and your potential mentors to come to
a detailed understanding of what should be done.

Google will pay you for your time spent working, and we'll give you the best
mentoring you could wish for; we'll treat you like a serious full-time employed
developer. You'll not only get the guidance you need to learn how to code in an
international team, but also honest feedback on your coding, and the visibility
in a field where employers and research institutions are extremely eager to hire
proven talent.

None of the following ideas is written in stone: Get on the mailing list now,
tell us who you are and what you're interested in, and whether these ideas suit
you well!
