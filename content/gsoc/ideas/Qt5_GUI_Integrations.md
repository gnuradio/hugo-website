Idea: Wrap the Qt GUI sinks to appear in QtCreator, including the GUI aspects of their parameterization

## Prerequisites

* C++, Python proficiency

* Qt experienced

## Outcome

* Qt GUI Sinks usable as widgets in QtCreator (not necessarily already showing an "empty" GUI, just placeholders)

* Possible to import generate Qt GUI description file (UIC) into GRC

* Interface to map placeholders from GUI design to Qt GUI sinks in Flow graph

* Integration of that into GRC-generated Python code
