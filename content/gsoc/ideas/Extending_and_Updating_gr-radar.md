[gr-radar](https://github.com/kit-cel/gr-radar/) was a great and successful GSoC project that provided a few methods of radar in GNU Radio. This module is heavily used by academics, researchers, cybersecurity folks, and hobbyists. This project would work to improve upon the concepts already in there as well as add more radar techniques.

There are uncountable methods and techniques that could be added to this project, such as:


* SAR / InSAR methods

* Better passive radar support

* Speed camera applications

* Multi-antenna radar techniques

## Prerequisites
Signal processing and some radar basics are required. Code is written in C++ with some Python on the side, so the student must be able to handle these languages at the least.

## Outcome
Based on the student's interest, a subset of the radar techniques listed above (or others) are chosen as milestones for this project. All code must be merged back into gr-radar by the end of the summer.
