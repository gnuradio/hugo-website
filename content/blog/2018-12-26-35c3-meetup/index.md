# GNU Radio Users and Developers Meetup at 35c3

{{< img "headline*" "Meetup Logo" >}}

## Quick overview of 35c3

[35c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is the 2018
instance of the annual conference of the [Chaos Communication
Club](https://www.ccc.de).

It's happening in Leipzig, Germany from the 27th to
the 30th of December, and it hosts around 16·10³ people, all into different
topics of technology, security, and effects of technology on privacy, policy and
society as a whole.


As a FOSS project, GNU Radio has been the technological underpinning of many
larger and smaller talks of the past years – be it for investigating telephony
or M2M comms satellites, for making use of the surprisingly proprietary outernet
system, or in the analysis of security of remote control or cellular systems.

It's only logical that at such an event, many users of GNU Radio are present,
and thus, the idea of a GNU Radio meetup was born.


## Meetup facts

- Friday, 2018-12-28, 16:25 in lecture hall 11.

## Meetup structure

We'll have a quick and dirty meetup for all people dealing with, or wanting to
deal with, GNU Radio and its community and ecosystem.

Last year, we had a nice round of people shortly introducing themselves and
explaining the problems they solve with GNU Radio, and the problems they face
because they did so. That was very interesting, but the format (standing in a
room full of chairs) wasn't quite perfect.

This year, we'll make sure to make things suit the purpose even better: we'll
have half an hour (16:25–16:55) of quick meet'n'greet (so that people who just
quickly want to meet up and see each other can meet, exchange business cards
and/or public keys), before then moving on to a bar, food strip or assembly
(depending on the number and needs of the attendants) where we can have more
one-on-one talking. It's effectively what we've done last year, but this time,
let's call it a plan.

## Meetup topics 

If anyone wants to join, and has a topic to discuss that they think would be of
relevance to an audience that spans different industries and academic
disciplines, be sure to drop the GNU Radio mailing list
(discuss-gnuradio@gnu.org) a quick hint!
