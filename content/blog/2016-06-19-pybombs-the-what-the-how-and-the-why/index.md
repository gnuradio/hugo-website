# PyBOMBS

<p>PyBOMBS is good at building GNU Radio, UHD, and various Out of Tree (OOT) modules from source and then installing into a specified user directory rather than in the system files. PyBOMBS detects the user&apos;s Operating System and loads all of the prerequisites in the first stage of the build.</p>

## Resources

- Complete PyBOMBS documentation is in the [PyBOMBS README](https://github.com/gnuradio/pybombs#pybombs).
