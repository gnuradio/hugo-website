The last six months brought a small number of changes regarding the GNU Radio
project. Time to give an update!

### General Assembly September 2021

In September 2021, prior to GRCon, the General Assembly met for a "synchronous
meeting" (which is what we call official events with real-time voting/elections).

The meeting mainly comprised of the Board giving an update on activities and
finances, an election of the Board, and votes on new members to the GA. You can find the minutes
[here](https://github.com/gnuradio/gr-governance/blob/main/minutes/2021-09-02%20Synchronous%20GA%20Meeting.md).

The board election concluded with Martin Braun, Derek Kozel, and Marc Lichtman
being re-elected as members of the Board. For the initial assembly in 2020, it
had been decided to elect the Board only for a single year (instead of the usual
two-year term) as a way to iron out early issues with the new GNU Radio organization
structure. Unless any of the members step down, these members of the board will
remain in office until the synchronous GA meeting in late 2023.

Derek Kozel remains our Principal Investigator and main contact to The SETI
Institute.
