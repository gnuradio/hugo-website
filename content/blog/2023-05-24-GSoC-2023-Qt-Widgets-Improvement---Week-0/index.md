Hello everyone!

I am Rohit Bisht, a computer engineering student from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, India. I am thrilled to be a part of the Google Summer of Code program and work on the GNU Radio project. Over the next few months, I will be focusing on improving the gr-qtgui component by adding new widgets and enhancing the existing ones.

During this community bonding period, I have been diving deep into the GNU Radio project and getting acquainted with the gr-qtgui component. I have been exploring the codebase, studying the existing widgets, and understanding their functionalities. It's been an exciting journey so far, and I can already see the immense potential for improvement.

### About Project
One of the key areas I will be working on is adding a new MPEG Display widget. This widget will enable the visualization of video demodulation output, making it useful for video transmission applications. I am particularly excited about integrating it with the FFmpeg library, which will provide a wide range of benefits in terms of compatibility and usability. Users will be able to analyze video streams from different sources and perform demodulation and visualization with ease.

Another exciting task on my list is the development of the Matrix Sink widget. This widget will allow for the visualization of radar Doppler/range plane or 2D equalizer taps, which will be valuable for radar imaging and equalizer analysis. I am eager to explore the possibilities and create a powerful and intuitive widget that meets the needs of signal processing developers.

Moreover, I will be exploring the integration and support for QT Creator and QML design. This will enable the creation of complete GUI applications from GRC, giving users even more flexibility and customization options. I am excited about the possibilities this integration brings and how it will further expand the capabilities of GNU Radio.

### Community
During this community bonding period, I have been actively engaging with the GNU Radio community and seeking guidance from my mentors, Andrej Rode and Håkon Vågsether. Their experience and expertise will be invaluable in shaping my project and ensuring its success.

I am looking forward to an amazing summer with GNU Radio and the Google Summer of Code program. I am passionate about signal processing and software radio, and I am eager to contribute to the open-source community. Stay tuned for more updates on my progress as I embark on this exciting journey!

### Week 1 [preview] :

During the first week of coding, my primary focus will be on writing the Matrix Sink widget for the gr-qtgui component of GNU Radio. 

Here's a breakdown of the tasks and goals for week 1:

1. Create the initial widget structure using the QT framework and C++.

2. Implement the basic functionality for Matrix Sink.

3. Handle user interaction, such as zooming and panning, to enable better analysis and visualization.
