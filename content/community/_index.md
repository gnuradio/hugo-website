# Contacting the Community

GNU Radio is not a corporation, or a corporate project: We're a community
project. Hence, we very much live by talking to each other!

The GNU Radio project can be reached

* via Email using the GNU Radio discussion mailing list
  `discuss-gnuradio@gnu.org`, to which you can sign up
  [here](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss-gnuradio),
* via Matrix on our Matrix homeserver, e.g. using
  [chat.gnuradio.org](https://chat.gnuradio.org) 

<!--, or
* via IRC in #gnuradio on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat). Those two chat
  rooms are "bridged", the same messages appear on both.

# Contributing without Writing Code

The GNU Radio community has many motivated programmers – but often, we find
ourselves in need of help keeping focus, and velocity, on the non-coding side of
things:

Foremost, you can help by being an active member of the community: Join the
mailing list and/or the chat, and ask, and discuss!

* You can help by filing [issues on github](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues).
  Please don't use that to ask usage questions – that's what the contact methods
  above are for!
* Read the [official "GNU Radio Academy" tutorials](https://tutorials.gnuradio.org)
  and tell us what was good – and what wasn't.
* We host the [GNU Radio Wiki](https://wiki.gnuradio.org). A wiki is a website
  that everyone can edit! You can help there by
  * Fixing whenever you find a typo, or a factual error!
  * Adding information, or short examples, to the blocks you've been using in
    [the official Block documentation](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Category:Block_Docs).
* Give a talk, or advocate for GNU Radio, at your company, university, radio
  club or wherever you'd be found!
   * We have the annual GNU Radio conference, where you can submit technical
     talks, of course, centered around GNU Radio, but also adjacent fields:
     We've seen talks about radio education, radio astronomy, communication
     through the strangest media, …. All of them were worthwhile to be held at
     GRCon.
   * There's the
     [European GNU Radio days](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzddPoztcHLuwFWRPJTNrQ/videos),
     and these are just as great!
   * If you're coming in from the ham radio side, the [SDR
     Academy](https://sdra.io/) is a great place to talk!
* We're also accepting feature requests on the issue tracker - make sure to use
  the feature request template, and be as clear as possible! A good feature
  request not only tells us what *you* want GNU Radio to do, but also how it
  helps the community. If possible, sketch things well enough for us to
  immediately understand what is meant!

We also have a lot of other community functions that we struggle to fill well.
For example, if you're planning on participating in GRCon, abd don't mind
helping out there, please do get in touch; we might even have some small task
beforehand, which we can't stem ourselves, making something big possible.

If you're already an experienced GNU Radio user, and have an idea for a project
that a student could do that would benefit the overall GNU Radio community,
[our Google Summer of Code engagement](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoC)
would be worth contributing to – by volunteering to become a mentor.

# Contributing by Writing Code

* The [github bug tracker](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues) is ripe
  with bugs that need fixing – find one, fix it! Sometimes we have entries
  marked as "good first issue", but that doesn't mean we'd not be happy about
  *any* kind of bug fix.
* Review [pull requests](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/pulls), and
  comment on them. This is as important as writing code and submitting pull
  requests, as the hours spent reviewing code our done by a group of people
  that's smaller than the group of people submitting code!
* Package things: If you know there's a project (for example, an out-of-tree
  module) that would benefit from being packaged for your package manager of
  choice, or if the GNU Radio package on that can be improved, do it. We'll
  always have an open ear for such endeavours – reach out!
* Make an addition to GNU Radio: Whether it's a bug fix, or a feature that you
  think has an audience that is a significant part of the GNU Radio community,
  do not be frightened to upstream it! If in doubt, even and especially before
  you even start working on things, the mailing list and chat room has helpful
  minds.

# Contributing Financially

GNU Radio's financial organisation happens through the [SETI
Institute](https://www.seti.org), which in the US is a 501(c)(3) charity (that
means your donations might be tax deductible). If you want to:

## [Donate](https://donorbox.org/gnuradio)

Donations help pay infrastructure bills, give us financial stability allowing us
to plan GRCon more robustly, and pay for the small things such as stickers.
